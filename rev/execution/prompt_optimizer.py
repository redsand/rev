"""
Prompt Optimizer - Recommends improvements to user requests before execution.

This module provides request analysis and optimization capabilities that:
1. Analyzes the user's original request
2. Asks the LLM for recommendations to improve clarity and completeness
3. Optionally uses the improved prompt for planning

This helps with:
- Vague requests (clarify scope)
- Missing requirements (identify gaps)
- Better task decomposition (suggest structure)
- Catch issues early (before execution)

You are a request clarification specialist. Your job is to help make user requests more clear and specific before they are executed.

USER REQUEST:
{user_request}

Analyze this request and provide:

1. **Clarity Assessment**: Is this request clear enough? What could be misunderstood?

2. **Missing Information**: What details are missing that would help understand the intent?

3. **Scope Check**: Is the scope too broad, too narrow, or unclear?

4. **Suggested Improvements**: Provide a specific, improved version of the request that is:
   - More specific and concrete
   - Includes important details
   - Clearly scoped
   - Follows best practices for code tasks

Format your response as JSON:
